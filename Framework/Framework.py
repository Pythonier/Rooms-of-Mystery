# Framework for Rooms of Mystery
# Remember, this will be buggy, glitchy, and things may not work right - oh well, Framework wasn't designed to be perfect.

# Importing some things
import time
import sys

# Firstly, I want a slow typed game name. Let's define that...suppose it could be used for anything where it's needed.

    for letter in str:
        sys.stdout.write(letter)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        time.sleep(0.1)

# Let's create the opening sequence - use the print_slow for title
print "\nWaking up inside a place you don't remember - always fun."
print "But this place seems different, darker, mysterious."
print "You're in for a long night. Welcome to..."
print_slow("\nROOMS OF MYSTERY") # slow printing text thanks to print_slow
